career-profile: 
    title: Research Topic
    text: 'The functional and genetic variation of the small intestinal microbiome selected upon by the Western diet'


studies:
    - education:
      degree: Post-Doc with Dr. Robert Britton
      university: Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA
      time: 2017-Present
      details: "I am determining how gut hormone secretion is altered by dietary sugar-derived microbial metabolites."
    - education:
      degree: Post-Doc with Dr. Ruth Ley
      university: Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA
      time: 2011-2017
      details: "I discovered that beneficial microbes within the small intestine are resilient to the toxicity of dietary fats. I demonstrated that resistance to dietary fat can be acquired through mutation of membrane and fatty acid metabolism genes; however, fatty acid resistance is not required for survival in a high fat diet fed host, indicating that host-associated microbes are protected from the toxicity of dietary fats." 
    - education:
      degree: Ph.D. in Genome Sciences with Dr. Bonita Brewer
      university: University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA
      time: 2006-2011
      details: "I determined that chromosomal replication is maintained over evolutionary time through the existence of redundant and potential replication sites in the genome. My research also revealed a previously unrecognized role of replication origins in genome rearrangements and gene amplifications."
    - education:
      degree: A.B. in Biology, summa cum laude, with Dr. Philip Meneely 
      university: Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, PA, USA
      time: 2002-2006
      details: "I used network analysis to predict the function of a C. elegans meiotic protein."
