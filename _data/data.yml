career-profile: 
    title: Research Topic
    text: 'I am investigating how the functional and genetic variation of the small intestinal microbiome that is selected by the Western diet'


studies:
    - education:
      degree: Post-Doc with Dr. Robert Britton
      university: Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA
      time: 2017-Present
      details: "I developed an in vitro microbial community representative of the small intestinal microbiome. Currently, I am developping this system combined with metagenomic-based whole genome assembly and modeling methods in order to identify the microbial gene variants selected in the presence of modern dietary sugars and ultimately determine the effect of these gene variants in a host."
    - education:
      degree: Post-Doc with Dr. Ruth Ley
      university: Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA
      time: 2011-2017
      details: "I discovered that beneficial microbes within the small intestine are resilient to the toxicity of dietary fats. I demonstrated that resistance to dietary fat can be acquired through mutation of membrane and fatty acid metabolism genes; however, host-associated microbes vary in resistance to dietary fat, indicating that host-associated microbes are protected from the toxicity of dietary fats." 
    - education:
      degree: Ph.D. in Genome Sciences with Dr. Bonita Brewer
      university: University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA
      time: 2006-2011
      details: "I determined that chromosomal replication is maintained over evolutionary time through the existence of redundant and potential replication sites in the genome. My research also revealed a previously unrecognized role of replication origins in genome rearrangements and gene amplifications."
    - education:
      degree: A.B. in Biology, summa cum laude, with Dr. Philip Meneely 
      university: Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, PA, USA
      time: 2002-2006
      details: "I used Systems Biology to create and analyze a protein network for a C. elegans meiotic protein of unknown function."
